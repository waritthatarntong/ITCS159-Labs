# ITCS159-Labs
This repository is a collection of labs that I have done in the course ITCS159 - Software Lab For Basic Scientific Problem Solving. It is for showcasing my experience in working with mathematical and scientific software tools in Python, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Sympy, and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook.
